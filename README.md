The Color Catcher game is a fast-paced reaction game that tests your reflexes and color coordination. Balls of various colors fall from the top of the screen, and your job is to catch them with the correct colored platform.

The game is built using the Pygame library in Python and is great for beginners who want to practice game development fundamentals such as collision detection, sprite movement, and event handling.
