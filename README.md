# 🎮 Color Catcher Game (Python)

A fun and simple arcade-style game built using Python and Pygame, where players must catch falling colored balls with the matching color bar.
The Color Catcher game is a fast-paced reaction game that tests your reflexes and color coordination. Balls of various colors fall from the top of the screen, and your job is to catch them with the correct colored platform.

The game is built using the Pygame library in Python and is great for beginners who want to practice game development fundamentals such as collision detection, sprite movement, and event handling.


## 🕹️ How to Play

Use a green-colored physical ball in front of your screen or webcam to control the in-game catcher.

Move the green ball left or right, and the catcher on screen will mimic your movement in real time.

A green ball falls from the top of the screen — your goal is to catch it with the catcher.

If you miss the falling ball, you lose a point or a life.

The game becomes faster over time, so keep your reflexes sharp!

🎥 This game uses computer vision (e.g., OpenCV) to track the green color in the video feed and translate it into in-game movement, blending physical interaction with digital gameplay.
